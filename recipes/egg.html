        <h1>Soy sauce marinated eggs (super complementary dish with rice or noodles)</h1>
        <ul><h2>For this recipes you will need:</h2>
          <li><h3>Eggs:</h3>  I used large eggs; cooking times are based on this size. <em>Tip: Older eggs are easier to peel.</em> </li>
          <li><h3>Vinegar</h3></li> Adding vinegar when boiling eggs softens the shell which makes it easier to peel.</li>
          <li><h3>Mirin</h3> This is a Japanese rice wine. Substitute with water or stock with a pinch of sugar and a few drops of vinegar.</li>
          <li><h3>Soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, white pepper (or black pepper), and water:</h3>for the sauce of the eggs </li>
        </ul>
        <ol><h2>How-to (for people who dont want to spend time on negligible task like making food)</h2> 
          <li>Cold eggs: Boil for 7 minutes straight from the fridge. Starting with cold eggs protect the center yolk from over cooking.</li>
          <li>Room temperature eggs: Allow the eggs to come to room temperature for about 30 minutes prior to cooking. Boil for 6 minutes. The egg shell is less likely to crack due to less variance in temperature.</li>
          <li>Ice Bath: Prepare in advance and immediately transfer the eggs to an ice bath to stop further cooking.</li>
          <li>Add the ingredients for the marinade in a plastic ziplock bag and place it in a bowl for stabilization. Gently add the eggs, then push out any extra air.</li>
        
        </ol>
        <p><h3>Soy sauce eggs can be used after 1 hour and up to 3 days later. Cut in half and serve atop a hot bowl of ramen. Enjoy!</h3>        </p>
        <p><h2>Result!</h2></p>
